- Supports objects like Text, Image, SVG Shapes, Video, Forms;
- You can then scale, move and rotate these objects with the mouse;
- Modify their properties: color, transparency, z-index, etc;
- You can also manipulate these objects altogether grouping them with a simple mouse selection;
- And all this works with clear HTML code which you can get at any moment of time.

History
---
RiseJS development started at 21/08/2014 as a foundation for lightbox editor - interactive resource where you can create your own lightboxes with mouse. The idea was to create JavaScript based-editor without dependencies, which would make it easy to manipulate HTML elements like `<a>`, `<div>`, `<span>` and others.

Since perfomance and customability was one of the most critical requirements, we choose subclassing architecture without any dependencies.

Later, RiseJS grew into a collection of distinct objects and got a flexible structure that allow easily extends exists features and remove that you don't need.
